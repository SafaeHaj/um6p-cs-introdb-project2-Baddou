Airline Related Module:

The final page of our project is exclusively dedicated to the airline, ensuring restricted access to ordinary users. This secure page grants airline staff the authority to update and delete flights through a user-friendly form. To access this functionality, airline personnel must authenticate themselves using a robust login system, incorporating features like strong password policies and possibly multi-factor authentication for heightened security. Through role-based access control, specific roles such as "Admin" or "Airline Staff" are assigned to distinguish between different levels of users, allowing only authorized staff to make changes. The flight management form, accessible only to authenticated and authorized users, facilitates the seamless updating and deletion of flight details, with built-in validation checks to maintain data accuracy.
